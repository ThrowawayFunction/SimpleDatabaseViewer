# SimpleDatabaseViewer
very lightweight and simple MySQL viewer. One of my first projects in C#. Uses Windows Forms and MySQL.

This tool was made out of necessity,as I was not familiar with how to make a program connect to a database.
I used this to learn about connection strings.

The viewer is setup so that it can only read, not write, even if the user has permission to make edits. 
Simply replacing every instance of "MySQL" with "SQL" in the code would allow this program to instead connect to a normal
SQL database. This program is pretty much as complete as I plan to make it, as it was more a tool to learn, not to use.

It does not nicely show all types of data, and some tables may error out.
